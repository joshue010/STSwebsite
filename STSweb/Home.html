            <h2 id="h2-about">About Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p id="p2-introduction">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. From self-driving cars to voice assistants, AI has the potential to transform various industries.</p>
            <p id="p3-discovery"><strong>Discover more about its advantages, disadvantages, applications, and impact in the Philippines!</strong></p>
            <hr>
            <h3>What is AI?</h3>
            <p>Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (the use of rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. AI systems can be trained to perform a variety of tasks such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.</p>
            <p>AI is an interdisciplinary field, encompassing areas such as machine learning, cognitive computing, natural language processing, robotics, and expert systems. It has evolved significantly, and now includes more advanced technologies like deep learning, reinforcement learning, and neural networks.</p>
            <p>AI technologies are already transforming industries such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and education, and are expected to continue doing so as advancements in AI accelerate.</p>

        <section id="advantages">
            <h2 id="h2-advantages">Advantages of AI</h2>
            <p id="p4-advantages">AI brings enhanced efficiency, accuracy, and scalability to repetitive or data-intensive tasks. It enables improved decision-making and allows businesses to focus on strategic initiatives by reducing human error and optimizing operational processes.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>How does AI work?</h3>
            <p>AI systems are typically built on machine learning algorithms that enable them to learn from large sets of data. Through a process called supervised learning, AI is trained with labeled data to predict or classify outcomes. In unsupervised learning, AI finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data.</p>
            <p>Deep learning models use artificial neural networks with multiple layers to improve learning and pattern recognition. Reinforcement learning allows AI agents to learn through trial and error by receiving feedback from their actions, enabling autonomous decision-making processes.</p>
            <h3>Some of the main advantages of AI include:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> AI can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up time for more creative or complex work.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> AI systems can handle vast amounts of data far beyond human capability.</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> With proper training, AI systems can make decisions with much higher accuracy than humans in some domains.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> AI can perform tasks much faster than humans, reducing time spent on processes like data entry, analysis, and reporting.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost-effectiveness:</strong> Over time, AI can reduce costs by automating operations and improving resource management.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="disadvantages">
            <h2 id="h2-disadvantages">Disadvantages of AI</h2>
            <p id="p5-disadvantages">Despite its significant advantages, AI presents certain challenges and drawbacks that need to be addressed. Some of these include the potential for job displacement, ethical concerns around AI decision-making, and the bias that can be built into AI systems based on the data they are trained on.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Challenges of AI</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Job Displacement:</strong> Automation powered by AI may replace certain jobs, leading to unemployment in some sectors. For example, autonomous vehicles could replace truck drivers, and AI chatbots could replace customer service representatives.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Bias:</strong> AI systems are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the data is biased or incomplete, AI systems can make flawed decisions that perpetuate inequality or errors.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong> The decision-making processes of some AI models, such as deep neural networks, are difficult to explain. This lack of transparency can pose ethical issues, especially in critical applications like healthcare and law enforcement.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> As AI systems become more integrated into everyday life, the risk of cyberattacks targeting AI-powered infrastructure and applications also grows.</li>
                <li><strong>Dependence on Technology:</strong> Over-reliance on AI may result in a loss of human skills, particularly in areas such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity.</li>
